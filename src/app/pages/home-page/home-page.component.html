          Our initial S1 system was solar powered and grew plants 30% faster and
          used 0.15% of the power compared to other popular hydroponics systems
          while having a $20 budget. S1 ran on a atmega microcontroller, and used
          our new methodology, leading less space and water usage.

          S2 is a 300 lb multi-level lift system used to mechanize our novel 
          (patent-pending) lifting and lowering platform hydroponic 
          system. Our advanced sensor suite and control solution 
          allows us to modulate lighting parameters, composition of 
          nutrient solution (pH, EC, DO), ambient state (temperature,
          humidity), and more.

          Aside from the automation software for S2 that includes 
          subcomponents like control theory and microcontrollers,
          data monitoring has been another of our key software focuses. 
          Via our large onboard sensor suite and the utilization of 
          various computer vision and machine learning algorithms 
          for tasks like stereo 3D mapping, foliage segmentation, 
          disease detection, and foliage prediction, we can 
          isolate what parameters best optimize for growth speed. 
          We built a web app that allows us to continuously livestream 
          the state of the system.

          Our robot code is written in CPP, and will soon be switched to the ROS2 framework.

          Our challenge is to use this system to grow heads of lettuce consistently in under 20 days, a significant reduction from comparing systems in the field. We are building this expressly for research and educational purposes, hoping to further the field with some of the data we collect - the intent is not to sell. We are a fully student led team trying to bring this project to fruition, with the aim of learning as much as we can about software, mechanical, and electrical engineering along the way. However, we currently lack a funding source - individual contributions and corporate sponsorships are much appreciated.
